I originally wrote this game as an extended prototype based on the Space Hipster tutorial on GameDev Academy - http://www.gamedevacademy.org/html5-phaser-tutorial-spacehipster-a-space-exploration-game/.

Eventually I found the gameplay to be pretty limited and not very fun, as well as not very fun to build, so I've decided to just release it as is, with open source code found on my github account. It does have a lot of problems and hasn't been thoroughly tested, but maybe someone out there will find it useful?
